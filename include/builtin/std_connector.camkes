/**
 * @file
 * 
 * This file defines a list of connectors. A connector is an instance of a
 * connection, allowing two components communicate with each other. Different
 * connectors are used for different purposes.
 * 
 * In essence, connector defines how exactly a component connects to another
 * component. There are two parts, from and to. Most of the connectors are
 * defined such that the "to" component sends data to the "from" component. So
 * the "to" component is more like a sender and the "from" component is like a
 * receiver. Having said that, a totally different semantic can be implemented.
 * It's really up to the programmer to decide it.
 * 
 * To use the connector, you define it like this:
 * 
 *	connection RPC util_fatfs_FS(from util.fs, to fatfs.fs);
 * 
 * where the RPC conenctor is an instance of util_fatfs_FS connection. It
 * connects util.fs interface to fatfs.fs interface.
 * 
 * Please look at fatfs.camkes for more details.

/**
 * Asynchronous event connector
 * 	
 * Once the connection has been established, the consumer could wait for
 * asynchronous signal sending from the emitter. The waiting process can be
 * blocked or non-blocked. The sending process is non-blocked, that is the
 * emitter can send data at any time and at any rate.
 * 
 * One of the advantages of this connector is if the consumer executes much
 * faster than the emitter. The consumer could do other stuff while waiting for
 * the asynchronous signal from the emitter. However it's harder to synchronize
 * the components.
 * 
 * In the current implementation, a component can only use at most 32
 * asynchronous event connectors. Anything more than that may result in
 * unpredictable behaviour.
