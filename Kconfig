    int "Component stack size"
    default 16384
    range 1 1073741824 # <-- 2^30
    help
        Stack size to allocate per-component, in bytes. Note that this value
        should be page-aligned. If not, it will be rounded up.

    config CAMKES_DEFAULT_HEAP_SIZE
    int "Component heap size"
    default 1048576
    range 0 1073741824 # <-- 2^30
    help
        Heap size to allocate per-component, in bytes.

    config CAMKES_CPP
    bool "Pre-process with CPP"
    default n
    help
        Run CPP on the input specification(s) before parsing them into an AST.
        This can allow you to write parameterised specs in the case of more
        complex systems.

    config CAMKES_SYSLIB
    string "Name of C stdlib syscall backing library"
    default sel4muslccamkes
    help
        This option sets the name of the backing library which will be linked with camkes
        components. This defaults to sel4muslcsys, which is a minimal syscall library for
        muslc.

    config CAMKES_IMPORT_PATH
    string "Search path for components and interfaces"
    default ""
    help
        CAmkES can include components and interfaces stored outside the current application
        directory. This option is a space delimited list of absolute paths to directories
        to be searched for components or interfaces included with angle brackets.

    config CAMKES_DEFAULT_PRIORITY
    int "Default thread priority"
    # Default to one less than max prio to avoid interleaving our output with
    # the CapDL initialiser.
    default 254
    range 1 255
    help
        Default priority for component threads if this is not overridden via an
        attribute. Generally you want to set this as high as possible due to
        the suboptimal seL4 scheduler.

    choice
    prompt "Error handling"
    default CAMKES_ERROR_HANDLER_CONFIGURABLE
    help
        Select the mode of error handling used in the glue code. It should only
        be necessary to adjust this setting if you are doing verification.
        Otherwise, the default error handling mechanism allows for
        configuration at runtime.

    config CAMKES_ERROR_HANDLER_CONFIGURABLE
    bool "Standard"
    help
        Standard error handling mechanism, that is configurable by the user at
        runtime. See the documentation for details of the API for this.

    config CAMKES_ERROR_HANDLER_GUARD
    bool "Guards"
    help
        Use verification-visible guards at the site of each potential error.
        Note that this assumes that none of the error conditions are possible.
        If you are trying to verify code, you will be forced to prove that none
        of the error conditions can ever actually occur.

    config CAMKES_ERROR_HANDLER_ABORT
    bool "Abort"
    help
        Call "abort" inline when an error occurs. For debugging purposes, this
        is probably not the behaviour you want as it will give you no
        information about the error. The standard error handling mechanism has
        a nicer default for debugging. This mode is primarily useful when you
        want to verify code whose error handlers are unreachable for
        non-trivial reasons.

    config CAMKES_ERROR_HANDLER_DISCARD
    bool "Discard"
    help
        Perform the "discard" action on any error that occurs. The advantage of
        this over simply configuring this behaviour via the standard mechanism
        is that you will not need to reason about any of the complicated error
        handling structures or control flow. This has no implementation
        advantages over the standard mechanism.

            Instead of using the internal ELF parsing functionality, it is
            possible to call out to your toolchain's objdump to perform
            required operations. This is more fragile than using internal
            functionality, but can provide a performance boost in compilation
            times. If you set this to auto (default), CAmkES will use your
            toolchain's objdump if it is in your PATH.

        help
            Detect when it is safe to exclude locking operations in the seL4RPC connector and
            automatically do so. This is an optimisation that can improve the performance of
            this connector.

        config CAMKES_OPTIMISATION_CALL_LEAVE_REPLY_CAP
        bool "Leave reply cap in place"
        default y
        help
            Detect scenarios where a reply cap obtained can never be overwritten
            and operate on it in place instead of saving it to a free cap slot. This
            is an optimisation that can improve the performance of connectors that
            use seL4_Call. Under the right conditions, with this optimisation
            enabled, it is possible to hit the IPC fastpath on return.

        config CAMKES_OPTIMISATION_SPECIALISE_SYSCALL_STUBS
        bool "Specialise syscall stubs"
        default y
        help
            Detect when glue code overhead could be reduced with a custom syscall
            stub and generate and use this instead of the libsel4 stubs. This does
            not affect whether a given IPC will hit the fastpath, but it does
            reduce the userlevel overhead of these system calls. In ideal
            conditions this will give you RPC as fast as native seL4 IPC. This only
            has an effect on ARM.

        config CAMKES_LARGE_FRAME_PROMOTION
        bool "Large frame promotion"
        default y
        help
            Some hardware platforms support multiple page sizes. In components with
            large virtual address spaces, it is possible to reduce memory usage
            (and consequent load time) by backing the component's address space with
            pages of these larger sizes. When this setting is enabled, small
            consecutive page mappings will be promoted to fewer consecutive large
            mappings. Note that larger frame sizes are directly mapped into page
            directories and can also save the overhead of an accompanying page
            table.

        config CAMKES_PYTHON_OPTIMIZE
        bool "Enable Python optimisations (-O)"
        # Note that you cannot enable -OO (strip docstrings as well) because PLY
        # needs them.
        default n
        help
            Pass -O to Python when running CAmkES. This causes Python to produce
            optimised bytecode that runs significantly faster. Note that this
            option will disable assertions and therefore it is not recommended to
            enable it if you are working on the internals of CAmkES itself.

        config CAMKES_PLY_OPTIMIZE
        bool "Enable PLY optimisations"
        default n
        help
            Run the CAmkES parsing library, PLY, in an optimised configuration.
            With this enabled, docstrings and regexs are compiled during an
            execution and then re-used during following executions rather than
            re-compiling. This option significantly hampers PLY's diagnostics so it
            is not recommended to enable this if you are working on the internals
            of CAmkES itself.

            CPython interpreter should be acceptable for any normal use, but you
            may find PyPy provides better build system performance under some
            circumstances. To use PyPy, obviously you need it installed. The other
            interpreters are for profiling or dynamic analysis.

        help
            Hand out TCB caps to components. These caps are used by the component
            to exit cleanly by suspending. Disabling this option leaves components
            with an empty slot in place of their TCB cap. This means they will cap
            fault when attempting to exit. The advantage is that your resulting
            CapDL specification contains no TCB caps and is thus easier to reason
            about.

        config CAMKES_SUPPORT_INIT
        bool "Support init infrastructure"
        default y
        help
            Support the pre_init, post_init and interface init functions as part of
            component startup. These functions allow extra functionality, but
            introduce some endpoint caps for synchronisation. You probably want
            this option enabled unless you are targetting verification.

        config CAMKES_PRUNE_GENERATED
        bool "Prune generated C files"
        depends on BUILDSYS_CPP_SEPARATE
        default n
        help
            When selected, this option minimises the number of C functions in a
            given generated file. This can be done because the CAmkES generation
            logic knows which functions are required by the user's components and
            which are not. This option is only sensible to use in combination with
            separate pre-processing or otherwise the generated C files are already
            minimal. Note, you will need libclang-dev installed to enable this
            option.

            Path to an installation of LLVM. This is only required if you need to
            rebuild or run the pruner tool, which depends on LLVM. If LLVM and
            libclang are installed in the standard system paths you do not need to
            set this option.
